Reference: [Working with Database Metadata](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/tutorial/metadata.html#tutorial-working-with-metadata)

The central element of both SQLAlchemy Core and ORM is the <span class="hl">SQL Expression Language</span> that allows fluent construction of SQL queries.

The foundation for these queries <span class="hl">database metadata</span> which are Python objects that represent DB concepts like **table** and **columns**.

The most common foundational objects for DB metadata are 
* `MetaData`
* `Table`
* `Column`

# Setting up MetaData with Table objects

The database **Table** is represented by a Python object `Table`.
* The `Table` is constructed either by
  1. `Table` constructor
  2. ORM Mapped classes (ORM Declarative Forms)


> <span class="hl">MetaData</span> object
>
> We always start with a collection called `MetaData` that stores a series of `Table` objects.

A straightforward way to make this collection is

```python
from sqlalchemy import MetaData
metadata_obj = MetaData()
```
