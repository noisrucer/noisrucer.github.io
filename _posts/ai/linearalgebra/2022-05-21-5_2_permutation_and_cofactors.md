**[1]** **2 by 2**: $$ad-bc$$ has $$2!$$ terms with $$\pm$$ signs. **n by n**: $$det(A)$$ **adds n! terms with** $$\pm$$ **signs**.

**[2]** For $$n=3$$, $$det(A)$$ adds $$3!=6$$ terms. Two terms are $$+a_{12}a_{23}a_{31}$$ and $$-a_{13}a_{22}a_{31}$$. **Rows 1, 2, 3, and columns 1, 2, 3 appear once in each term**.

**[3]** That minus sign came because the column order $$3, 2, 1$$ needs one exchange to recover $$1, 2, 3$$.

**[4]** The six terms include $$+a_{11}a_{22}a_{33}-a_{11}a_{23}a_{32}=a_{11}(a_{22}a_{33}-a_{23}a_{32}) = a_{11}$$(**cofactor** $$C_{11}$$)

**[5]** Always $$det(A) = a_{11}C_{11}+a_{12}C_{12d+ \cdots + a_{1n}C_{1n}}$$. Cofactors are determinants of size $$n-1$$.

> # Three ways to find determinant

We can find the determinent in three ways

1. **Pivot formula**
2. **Big formula**
3. **Cofactors**

> # Pivot Formula

Elimination leads $$A$$ to $$PA=LU$$, then the **pivots** $$d_1,...,d_n$$ are on the **diagonal** of the upper triangular $$U$$. Then, the **product of the pivots (with sign) is the determinant**.

We can show that it's true very simply.

$$ det(P)det(A) = det(L) det(U) = (1)(d_1d_2\cdots d_n) $$

Since $$det(P)=\pm 1$$,

$$ det(A) = \pm d_1d_2 \cdots d_n $$

Now, consider the **corner** submatrix $$A_k$$ (first $$k$$ pivots). We can find the $$k^{th}$$ pivot using the determinant

$$ k^{th}\ \text{pivot} = d*k = \frac{det(A_k)}{det(A*{k-1})} $$

The big formula has **n! terms**. Each product has **one entry** from **each row and each column** which is why there're $$n!$$ cases (permutations).

Notice that the **sign** of the product is determined by the **permutation matrix** for each product.

For example,

$$ \begin{vmatrix} a*{11} & & \\\ & a*{22} & \\\ & & a*{33} \end{vmatrix} = a*{11}a*{22}a*{33}\begin{vmatrix} 1 & & \\\ & 1 & \\\ & & 1 \end{vmatrix} $$

## Summary

$$det(A)$$ = sum over all $$n!$$ column permutations $$P=(\alpha, \beta,...,w)$$

$$ det(A) = \sum det(P) a*{1\alpha}a*{2\beta}\cdots a\_{nw} $$

> # Cofactor

The determinant can also be found using **cofactor**. From the big formula above, 3 by 3 matrix has a determinant which is a sum of $$3!$$ products. Notice that you can convert the 6 products into **3 pairs**.

$$ det(A) = a*{11}(a*{22}a*{33}) + a*{12}(a*{23}a*{31}-a*{21}a*{33})+a*{13}(a*{21}a*{32}-a*{22}a\_{31}) $$

The quantities in **parentheses** are called **cofactors** which are 2 by 2 determinants from rows 2 and 3. The first row contributes the factors $$a_{11}, a_{12}, a_{13}$$ and the lower rows form the cofactors $$C_{11}, C_{12}, C_{13}$$

Define $$M_{1j}$$ is a submatrix with row 1 and column $$j$$ **removed**. Then, the cofactors along row $$1$$ are defined,

$$ C*{1j} = (-1)^{1+j} det(M*{1j}) $$

Then, the determinant can be expressed as

$$ det(A) = a*{11}C*{11} + a*{12}C*{12} + \cdots + a*{1n}C*{1n} $$

## General form

The determinant is the dot product of any row $$i$$ of $$A$$ with its cofactors using other rows:

$$ det(A) = a*{i1}C*{i1} + a*{i2}C*{i2} + \cdots + a*{in}C*{in} $$

Each cofactor $$C_{ij}$$ (order $$n-1$$ without row $$i$$ and column $$j$$) includes its correct sign:

$$ C*{ij} = (-1)^{i+j}det(M*{ij}) $$
