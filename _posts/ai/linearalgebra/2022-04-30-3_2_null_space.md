> # Keywords

**[1]** The **nullspace** $$N(A)$$ in $$\mathbb{R}^n$$ contains all solutions $$x$$ to $$Ax=0$$. This includes $$x=0$$.

**[2]** Elimination (from $$A$$ to $$U$$ to $$R$$) does not change the nullspace: $$N(A)=N(U)=N(R)$$

**[3]** The **reduced row echelon form** $$R=\text{rref}(A)$$ has all pivots = 1, with zeros above and below.

**[4]** If column $$j$$ of $$R$$ is free (no pivot), there is a **special solution** to $$Ax=0$$ with $$x_j=1$$

**[5]** Number of pivots = number of nonzero rows in $$R$$ = **rank** $$r$$. There are $$n-r$$ free columns

**[6]** Every matrix with $$m < n$$ has nonzero solutions to $$Ax=0$$ in its nullspace

> # Null Space

The nullspace is a **subspace** contains **all solutions** to $$Ax=0$$. Suppose $$A$$ is a $$m$$ by $$n$$ matrix. The right hand side is $$b=0$$. Then, one immediate solution is $$x=0$$. For **invertible** matrices, this is the **only solution**. For not invertible matrices, there are **nonzero** solutions to $$Ax=0$$. Then, each solution $$x$$ belongs to the null space of $$A$$. We denote the nullspace as $$N(A)$$.

> The nullspace $$N(A)$$ consists of all solutions to $$Ax=0$$. These vectors $$x$$ are in $$\mathbb{R}^n$$

$$N(A)$$ is a subspace and we can verify quickly. Suppose $$x$$ and $$y$$ are in $$N(A)$$. In other words, $$Ax=0, Ay=0$$. Then, $$A(x+y)=0$$ and $$A(cx)=0$$.

The solution vectors $$x$$ have $$n$$ components (`A = m x n`). They are vectors in $$\mathbb{R}^n$$, so **the nullspace is a subspace** of $$\mathbb{R}^n$$. The column space $$C(A)$$ is a subspace of $$\mathbb{m}$$.

> $$N(A)$$ is a **subspace** of $$\mathbb{R}^n$$

> $$C(A)$$ is a **subspace** of $$\mathbb{R}^m$$

## Example 1

Describe the nullspace of $$A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\ 3 & 6 \end{bmatrix}$$.

We can quickly observe that this matrix is **non-invertible** which means that there exist solutions to $$Ax=0$$ other than $$x=0$$. Let's apply elimination

$$ x_1 + 2x_2 = 0 $$
$$ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 0 = 0 $$

Hence, the **line** $$x_1 + 2x_2 = 0$$ is the nullspace $$N(A)$$. It contains all solutions $$(x_1, x_2)$$.

> # Special Solution

To describe the nullspace or solutions to $$Ax=0$$, there's an efficient way. In the example above, choose **one point** on the line (one **special solution**). Then, all points on the line are **multiples** of this one. We choose $$x_2 = 1$$. Then, from $$x_1 + 2x_2 = 0$$, we know that $$x_1 = -2$$. Thus, the **special solution** is $$s = (-2, 1)$$. The solution is special because **we set the free variable to** $$x_2 = 1$$. In general,

> The nullspace of $$A$$ consists of **all combinations** of the special solutions to $$Ax = 0$$

## Example 2

Suppose $$A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \end{bmatrix}$$. Describe $$N(A)$$.

The **last two components are free** and we choose them specially as $$1, 0$$ and $$0, 1$$. Then the first components -2 and -3 are determined by the equation $$Ax=0$$.

$$ s_1 = \begin{bmatrix} -2 \\\ 1 \\\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, s_2 = \begin{bmatrix} -3 \\\ 0 \\\ 1\end{bmatrix} $$

The two key steps are

> **[1]** reducing $$A$$ to its **reduced echelon form** $$R$$

> **[2]** find the **special solutions** to $$Ax=0$$

> # Pivot Columns and Free Columns

The first column of $$A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \end{bmatrix}$$ contains the **only one pivot**. The first component of $$x$$ is **not free**. The **free components** correspond to columns with **no pivots**. The **special choice** (one or zero) is only for the **free variables** in the special solutions.

## Example 3

Find the nullspace of $$A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\\ 3 & 8 \end{bmatrix}$$ and $$C = \begin{bmatrix} A & 2A \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 2 & 4 \\\ 3 & 8 & 6 & 16 \end{bmatrix}$$

$$N(A)$$ is straightforward. The only solution to $$Ax=0$$ is $$x=0$$. Hence, the $$N(A)=Z$$. It contains only the single point $$x=0$$ in $$\mathbb{R}^2$$.

However, $$C$$ has **extra columns**. Elimination will produce pivots in the first two columns of $$C$$, but **the last two columns** of $$C$$ and $$U$$ are **"free"**. **They don't have pivots**.

$$ C = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 2 & 4 \\\ 3 & 8 & 6 & 16 \end{bmatrix}\ \text{becomes}\ U = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 2 & 4 \\\ 0 & 2 & 0 & 4 \end{bmatrix} $$

Since column 3 and column 4 are free columns, **free variables** are $$x_3$$ and $$x_4$$. Then, we make special choices of ones and zeros,

$$ x_3=1, x_4=0 $$

$$ x_3=0, x_4=1 $$

The **pivot variables** $$x_1$$ and $$x_2$$ are determined by the equation $$Cx=0$$ or $$Ux=0$$. $$Cx=0$$ or $$Ux=0$$ bring the **same nullspace**: **elimination doesn't change solutions**.

$$ s_1 = \begin{bmatrix} -2 \\\ 0 \\\ 1 \\\ 0 \end{bmatrix},\ s_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\ -2 \\\ 0 \\\ 1\end{bmatrix} $$

> # Reduced Row Echelon Form R

So far, we have only done eliminatio in a way that $$A$$ becomes the **upper triangular matrix** $$U$$. However, we can go further to make it simpler in two ways.

> **[1]** Produce **zeros above pivots** - Use pivot rows to eliminate upward in $$R$$

> **[2]** Produce **ones in the pivots** - Divide the whole pivot row by its pivot

Those steps of course do not change the zero vector $$b$$. So the nullspace stays the same: $$N(A) = N(U) = N(R)$$. This nullspace becomes easiest to see when we have the **reduced row echelon form**: $$R = \text{rref}(A)$$. **The pivot columns of** $$R$$ **contains** $$I$$.

$$ U = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 2 & 4 \\\ 0 & 2 & 0 & 4 \end{bmatrix} $$

$$ R = \begin{bmatrix} \textbf{1} & \textbf{0} & 2 & 0 \\\ \textbf{0} & \textbf{1} & 0 & 2 \end{bmatrix} $$

Now, notice that **(free column 3) = 2 (pivot column 1)**. We're looking for nullspace. So the special solution $$s_1 = (-2, 0, 1, 0)$$. The special solutions are much easier to find when we have $$Rx = 0$$.

**[Note]**

When the nullspace is $$Z$$ (zero nullspace), the **columns of** $$A$$ **are independent**.

**C(A)**

The columns of $$R$$ have **4 components** so they lie in $$\mathbb{R}^4$$. Also, the fourth component of every column is $$0$$ so $$C(A)$$ is of the form $$(b_1, b_2, b_3, 0)$$.

**N(A)**

We have **3 pivot columns** and **4 free columns**. Hence, the solutions to $$Rx=0$$ or the nullspace are **all combinations of the 4 special solutions** - one for each free variable $$x_3, x_4, x_5, x_7$$.

> # $$n > m$$ means at least one free variable

This is an extremely important theorem. Suppose $$A$$ has **more columns than rows**, that is, $$n > m$$. Then, there is **at least one free variable**. In other words, $$A$$ always has **nonzero vectors in its nullspace**.

More specifically, for $$m x n$$ matrix, there must be **at least** $$n - m$$ free variables since the number of pivots cannot exceed $$m$$.

> Suppose $$Ax=0$$ has **more unknowns** than **equations** ($$n>m$$ = more columns than rows), there must be **at least one free column**. **Then** $$Ax=0$$ **has nonzero solutions**.

This is aligned with what we've seen in the invertibility. If $$n>m$$, then the matrix is surely **not invertible** or **singular**. For singular matrices, there are **nonzero solutions**. Then, the **special solutions** from **free variables** make up this nullspace.

The nullspace is a **subspace**. Its **dimension** is the **number of free variables**.

> # The Rank of a Matrix

The numbers `m x n` give the **size** of a matrix but not necessarily the **true size** of a linear system.

> The **true size** of $$A$$ is given by its **rank**. The **rank** of $$A$$ is the **number of pivots** $$r$$.

Another important property is

> Every **free column** is a **combination of earlier pivot columns**. It is the **special solutions** that tell us those combinations

Let's take an example:

$$ A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 2 & 4 \\\ 1 & 2 & 2 & 5 \\\ 1 & 3 & 2 & 6 \end{bmatrix} $$

$$ R = \begin{bmatrix} \textbf{1} & \textbf{0} & 2 & 3 \\\ \textbf{0} & \textbf{1} & 0 & 1 \\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\end{bmatrix} $$

$$ \text{Column 3 = 2 (column 1) + 0 (column 2)}\ \ s_1=(-2, -0, 1, 0) $$
$$ \text{Column 4 = 3 (column 1) + 1 (column 2)}\ \ s_2=(-3,-1,0,1) $$

> # Rank and Independent Columns

$$A$$ and $$U$$ and $$R$$ have $$r$$ **independent columns** (the pivot columns).

> The **rank** $$r$$ is the **"dimension" of the column space**.

> The **rank** $$r$$ is the **"dimension" of the row space**.

> Then, $$n-r$$ is the **"dimension" of the nullspace**
