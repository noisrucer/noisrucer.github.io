**[1]** The projection of a vector $$b$$ onto the line through $$a$$ is the closest point $$p = a\frac{a^Tb}{a^Ta}$$

**[2]** The error $$e = b - p$$ is perpendicular to $$a$$: Right triangle $$bpe$$ has $$\lVert p \rVert^2 + \lVert e \rVert^2 = \lVert b \rVert^2$$

**[3]** The **projection** of $$b$$ onto a subspace $$S$$ is the cloest vector $$p$$ in $$S$$; $$b-p$$ is orthogonal to $$S$$.

**[4]** $$A^TA$$ is invertible (and symmetric) only if $$A$$ has independent columns: $$N(A^TA)=N(A)$$

**[5]** Then the projection of $$b$$ onto the column space $$A$$ is the vector $$p = A(A^TA)^{-1}A^Tb$$

**[6]** The **projection matrix** onto $$C(A)$$ is $$p=A(A^TA)^{-1}A^T$$. It has $$p=Pb$$ and $$P^2=P=P^T$$

Suppose a line $$a$$ going through the origin. Along that line, we want to find the point $$p$$ **closest** to $$b$$. The key to projection is **orthogonality**

> The line from $$b$$ to $$p$$ is **perpendicular** to the vector $$a$$.

Then, the projection $$p$$ will be some **multiple** of $$a$$ so we call $$p=\hat{x}a$$.

Now we use a bit of algebra.

$$ e = b - p $$

$$ p=\hat{x}a $$

$$ e = b - \hat{x}a $$

$$ a^T(b-\hat{x}a)=0,\ \text{since a is perpendicular to e} $$

$$ \hat{x}a^Ta = a^Tb $$

$$ \therefore \hat{x} = \frac{a^Tb}{a^Ta} $$

$$ \therefore p = \frac{a^Tb}{a^Ta}a $$

> The projection of $$b$$ onto the line through $$a$$ is the vector $$p = \hat{x}a = \frac{a^Tb}{a^Ta}a$$

## Special cases

[1] If $$b=a$$ then $$\hat{x}=1$$. Then, the projection of $$a$$ onto $$a$$ is itself: $$Pa=a$$

[2] If $$b$$ is perpendicular to $$a$$, then $$a^Tb=0$$ so the projection is $$p=0$$

## Projection Matrix $$P$$

In the formula of $$p$$, what matrix is multiplying $$b$$? We can decompose it into

$$ p = \frac{a^Tb}{a^Ta}a = \left( \frac{aa^T}{a^Ta} \right) b = Pb $$

> The projection matrix $$P=\frac{aa^T}{a^Ta}$$

The rank of $$P$$ is $$1$$ and $$p$$ is in $$C(P)$$.

Suppose $$n$$ vectors $$a_1,...,a_n$$ in $$\mathbb{R}^m$$ and these $$a$$'s are linearly independent. Now, we want to find the combination $$p = \hat{x_1}a_1 + \cdots + \hat{x_n}a_n$$ **closest** to a given vector $$b$$.

We suppose the matrix $$A$$ has columns as $$a_1,...,a_n$$. The combinations in $$\mathbb{R}^m$$ are the vectors $$Ax$$ in the **column space**. We're looking for the particular combination $$p = A\hat{x}$$, the projection, that is closest to $$b$$.

Then,

$$ p = A\hat{x} $$

$$ e = b - p $$

$$ e = b - A\hat{x} $$

But $$e$$ is perpendicular to $$A$$,

$$ A^T(b-A\hat{x})=0 $$

$$ A^Tb = A^TA\hat{x} $$

Hence, we get

$$ \therefore \hat{x} = (A^TA)^{-1}A^Tb $$

$$ \therefore p = A\hat{x} = A(A^TA)^{-1}A^Tb $$

$$ \therefore P = A(A^TA)^{-1}A^T $$

where $$p$$ is the **projection** of $$b$$ onto $$A$$ and $$P$$ is the **projection matrix**.

Notice that since $$e$$ is **orthogonal** to $$C(A)$$, $$e$$ is in the **left-nullspace** $$N(A^T)$$. Also, $$A^TA$$ is **invertible** only if $$A$$ has **linearly independent columns**.

The projection matrix satisfies $$P^T=P$$,$$P^2=P$$, and $$Pb=p$$
