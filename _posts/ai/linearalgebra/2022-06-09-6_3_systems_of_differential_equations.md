**[1]** If $$Ax=\lambda x$$ then $$u(t) = e^{\lambda t}x$$ will solve $$\frac{du}{dt}=Au$$. Each $$\lambda$$ and $$x$$ give a solution $$e^{\lambda t}x$$

**[2]** If $$A = X \Lambda X^{-1}$$ then $$u(t)=e^{At}u(0)=Xe^{\Lambda t}X^{-1}u(0)=c_1 e^{\lambda_1t}x_1 + \cdots + c_n e^{\lambda_n t}x_n$$

**[3]** $$A$$ is **stable** and $$u(t) \rightarrow 0$$ and $$e^{At}\rightarrow 0$$ when all eigenvalues of $$A$$ have real part $$<0$$.

**[4]** **Matrix exponential** $$e^{At}=I + At + \cdots + (At)^n / n! + \cdots = X e^{\Lambda t}X^{-1}$$ if $$A$$ is diagonalizable

**[5]** **Second order equation First order system**: $$u'' + Bu' + Cu = 0$$ is quivalent to $$\begin{bmatrix} u \\\ u' \end{bmatrix}' = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\ -C & -B \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} u \\\ u' \end{bmatrix}$$

> # Differential Equations

Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are perfect for $$\frac{du}{dt}=Au$$. As a prior knowledge, the derivative of $$e^{\lambda t}$$ is $$\lambda e^{\lambda t}$$.

The main point is to **convert constant-coefficient differential equations into linear algebra**.

The ordinary equations $$\frac{du}{dt}=u$$ and $$\frac{du}{dt}=\lambda u$$ are solved by exponentials:

$$\frac{du}{dt}=u$$ products $$u(t)=Ce^t$$

$$\frac{du}{dt}=\lambda u$$ produces $$u(t)=Ce^{\lambda t}$$.

When $$t=0$$, we have $$u(0)=C$$. The solutions that start from $$u(0)$$ at $$t=0$$ are

$$ u(t) = u(0)e^t $$

$$ u(t)=u(0)e^{\lambda t} $$

This is the 1 by 1 case. Let's generalize to n by n. The unknown is a vector $$u$$. We start from the initial vector $$u(0)$$ and the $$n$$ equations contain a square matrix $$A$$. We expect $$n$$ exponents $$e^{\lambda t}$$ in $$u(t)$$, from $$n$$ $$\lambda's$$

$$ \frac{du}{dt}=Au,\ \ u(0)=\begin{bmatrix} u_1(0) \\\ \cdots \\\ u_n(0) \end{bmatrix}\ \text{at}\ t=0 $$

These differential equations are **linear** which means if $$u(t)$$ and $$v(t)$$ are solutions, so is $$Cu(t)+Dv(t)$$. Thus, the first job is to **find n "pure exponential solutions"** $$u=e^{\lambda t}x$$ by using $$Ax=\lambda x$$.

Notice that $$A$$ is a **constant matrix**. So $$\frac{du}{dt}=Au$$ is "linear with constant coefficients".

> Solve linear constant coefficient equations by exponentials $$e^{\lambda t}x$$, when $$Ax=\lambda x$$

> # Solution of $$\frac{du}{dt}=Au$$

## Pure exponential solution

The **pure exponential solution** is $$e^{\lambda x}$$ times a fixed vector $$x$$. $$\lambda$$ is an **eigenvalue** of $$A$$ and $$x$$ is the **eigenvector**.

> Choose $$u=e^{\lambda t}x$$ when $$Ax=\lambda x$$. Then, $$\frac{du}{dt}=\lambda e^{\lambda t}x$$ agrees with $$Au = A e^{\lambda t} x$$

After we fine the pure exponential solutions, the **complete solution** is the **linear combination** of those pure solutions

## Complete solution

$$ u(t) = Cu_1(t) + Du_2(t) $$

> # Summary: Three steps

**[1]** Write $$u(0)$$ as a **combination** $$c_1x_1 + \cdots + c_n x_n$$ **of the eigenvectors of A**

**[2]** Multiply each eigenvector $$x_i$$ by its **growth factor** $$e^{\lambda_i t}$$.

**[3]** The solution is the same combination of those pure solutions $$e^{\lambda t}x$$

$$ \frac{du}{dt}=Au $$

$$ u(t) = c_1 e^{\lambda_1 t}x_1 + \cdots + c_n e^{\lambda_n t}x_n $$
