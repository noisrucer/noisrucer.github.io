> # Keywords

**[1]** The column space $$C(A)$$ and the row space $$C(A^T)$$ both have dimension $$r$$ (the rank of $$A$$)

**[2]** The nullspace $$N(A)$$ has dimension $$n-r$$. The **left nullspace** $$N(A^T)$$ has dimension $$m-r$$

**[3]** Elimination produces bases for the row space and nullspace of $$A$$: They're the same for $$\mathbb{R}$$

**[4]** Elimination often changes the column space and left nullspace (but dimensions don't change)

**[5]** **Rank one matrices**: $$A=uv^T=\text{column times row}$$: $$C(A)$$ has basis $$u$$, $$C(A^T)$$ has basis $$v$$.

> # Four Fundamental Subspaces

The **rank** of a matrix is the **number of pivots**. The **dimension** of a subspace is the **number of vectors in a basis**. So we count pivots or basis vectors. The rank of $$A$$ **reveals the dimensions of ALL four fundamental subspaces**. Let's first what those four fundamental subspaces are

**[1]** The **row space** is $$C(A^T)$$, a subspace of $$\mathbb{R}^n$$

**[2]** The **column space** is $$C(A)$$, a subspace of $$\mathbb{R}^m$$

**[3]** The **nullspace** is $$N(A)$$, a subspace of $$\mathbb{R}^n$$

**[4]** The **left nullspace** is $$N(A^T)$$, a subspace of $$\mathbb{R}^m$$. This is our new space.

The row space of $$A$$ is the column space of $$A^T$$. The left nullspace solves $$A^Ty=0$$ which is the nullspace of $$A^T$$. The vectors $$y$$ go on the left side of $$A$$.

> # Part 1 Fundamental Theorem - Dimensions of four subspaces

We'll look at the dimensions of the four fundamental subspaces.

> The **row space** and **column space** have the same dimension $$r$$ which is the **rank** of the matrix.

> $$N(A)$$ and $$N(A^T)$$ have dimensions $$n-r$$ and $$m-r$$, to make up the full $$n$$ and $$m$$.

**The subspace dimensions for** $$A$$ **are the same as for** $$\mathbb{R}$$. $$A$$ is any matrix that reduces down to $$R = rref(A)$$.

## Row space $$C(A^T)$$

> $$A$$ **has the same row space as** $$R$$. **Same dimension** $$r$$ **and same basis**.

The reason is that the rows of $$A$$ are a combination of the rows of $$R$$ and vice-versa. Elimination changes rows, but **now row spaces**.

## Column space $$C(A)$$

> **The column space of** $$A$$ **has dimension** $$r$$. **The column rank equals the row rank**.

**[NOTE]** **Rank Theorem**: The number of **independent columns** = number of **independent rows**

Be careful that $$A$$ and $$R$$ might have different spaces. The right reason is that the **same** combinations of the columns are zero (or nonzero) for $$A$$ and $$R$$. In other words, $$Ax=0$$ **exactly when** $$Rx=0$$. The column spaces are different but their **dimensions are the same** - equal to $$r$$.

So the $$r$$ **pivots columns** of $$A$$ are a **basis** for its **column space** $$C(A)$$.

## Nullspace $$N(A)$$

> $$A$$ **has the same nullspace as** $$R$$. **Same dimension** $$n-r$$ and **same basis**

This is because the eliminiation does not change the solution space. The special solutions are a basis for the nullspace. There're $$n-r$$ free variables, so the dimension of $$N(A)$$ is $$n-r$$. So the dimension of column space + dimension of nullspace gives us the dimension of the whole subspace. This is the counting theorem: $$r + (n-r) = n$$.

$$ dim(C(A)) + dim(N(A)) = dim(\mathbb{R}^n) $$

## Left Nullspace $$N(A^T)$$

> The **left nullspace** of $$A$$ (nullspace of $$A^T$$) has dimension $$m-r$$

If we know $$A$$, then we know $$A^T$$. Since $$A^T$$ is $$n$$ by $$m$$, the whole space is now $$\mathbb{R}^m$$. The counting rule for this new $$A^T$$ is $$r + (m-r) = m$$. The left nullspace solve $$A^Ty=0$$. In other words, $$y^TA=0$$ so the $$y$$'s in the left nullspace **combine the rows** to give the zero row.
