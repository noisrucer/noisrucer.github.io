YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model has been increasingly popular especially due to its extremely fast speed. The original model, YOLOv1, was a breakthrough one-stage model but its performance was not so great despite its extremely fast speed (45 FPS). Joseph Redmon proposed the second version of YOLO model, **YOLOv2** which showed various improvements compared to the original model.

There're two branches of this version: **YOLO9000** which can detect over 9000 object categories and **YOLOv2** which we will mostly focus on today.

In the following chapters, we'll talk about the **improvements** to the original YOLOv2.

> # Better

## Summary

**YOLOv1** suffers **localization errors** and **relatively low recall** compared to region proposal-based methods. Thus, this paper mostly focuses on improving recall and localization while maintaining classification accuracy.

Many good performing detectors rely on large network or ensembling techniques but YOLOv2 aims for **more accurate but still fast** detector. Instead of scaling up the network, YOLOv2 **simplifies network and make the representation easier to learn**.

## Batch Normalization

YOLOv2 adopts **batch normalization** [paper link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167) which brings faster convergence and regularization effects. Batch normalization is added on all convolutional layers while dropout layers are removed. It brings more than $$2\%$$ mAP improvement.

## High Resolution Classifier

YOLOv1 trains the classifier at `224 x 224` scale and increases the reolution to `448 x 448` for detection. This sudden change in resolution makes it hard for the network to adjust to the new input resolution.

YOLOv2 first **fine-tunes** the classifier at the full `448 x 448` resolution for $$10$$ epochs on ImageNet. This gives the network some time to **adjust** its filters to work better on the higher resolution input.

This method brings almost $$4\%$$ mAP increase.

## Convolutional With Anchor Boxes

YOLOv2 adopts **anchors boxes** with which the model predicts the **relative coordinates** rather than direct predictions of the box coordinates. Predicting the parameterized coordinates **simplifies** the representation and makes the representation easier to learn.

> **[1]** **Shrink the input resolution to** `416 x 416`

The input resolution is shrunken to `416 x 416` instead of `448 x 448` to have an **odd number of locations** so that there is a **single center cell**. The reason we do this is that large objects tend to occupy the center of the image so it's good to have a single location.

YOLOv2's convolution layers downsample the input image by a factor of $$32$$, so the output feature map will be `13 x 13`.

> **[2]** **Objectness and class prediction for each anchor box**

In YOLOv2, the **objectness prediction** still predicts the **IoU of the GT box and the prediction box**. The **class prediction** predicts the **conditional probability** of that class given that there's an object.

The number of output channels is

$$\text{YOLOv1:}\ C+5B$$

$$\text{YOLOv2:}\ B(C+5)$$

---

Using anchors boxes bring a **small decrease** in accuracy. YOLOv1 predicts **98** boxes per image while YOLOv2 predicts **more than a thousand**.

- Without anchor boxes: `69.5 mAP`, `81% Recall`

- With anchor boxes: `69.2 mAP`, **`88% Recall`**

Even though the mAP decreases slightly, the recall increased. This implies that there's **more room to improve**.

## Dimension Clusters

|   _[YOLOv2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08242)_   |

**Hand-picked priors** (anchor boxes) often lead to suboptimal performances. Instead, YOLOv2 runs **k-means clustering** on the training set bounding boxes to **automatically pick good anchor boxes**.

Euclidean distance makes larger boxes more error than smaller boxes so the author proposed to use the **distance metric**

$$ d(box, centroid) = 1 - IOU(box, centroid) $$

The author suggested that **k=5** is a good tradeoff between the model capacity and high recall.

## Relative Location Prediction

| :----------------------------------------------: |
|   _[YOLOv2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08242)_   |

Instead of predicting offsets like in region proposal networks, YOLOv2 predicts location coordinates **relative to the location of the grid cell**. This bounds the ground truth to **fall between 0 and 1**. The sigmoid is used to make to fall in `[0, 1]`.

The network predicts `5` coordinates for **each bounding box**: $$t_x, t_y, t_w, t_h, t_o$$. If the cell is offset from the **top-left corner of the image** by $$(c_x, c_y)$$ and the **anchor box** has width and height $$p_w, p_h$$, then the predictions correspond to

$$ b_x = \sigma(t_x) + c_x $$

$$ b_y = \sigma(t_y) + c_y $$

$$ b_w = p_we^{t_w} $$

$$ b_h = p_h e^{t_h} $$

$$ Pr(object) \* IOU(b, object) = \sigma(t_o) $$

- $$b_x, b_y, b_w, b_h$$: **Actual** bounding box coordinates

- $$c_x, c_y$$: **Top-left** corner coordinates of the **cell**

- $$p_w, p_h$$: Anchor box width, height

- $$\sigma$$: logistic activation function: sigmoid

Becuase we **constrain the location prediction relative to the cell, the parametrization is easier to learn, making the network more stable**.

This prediction method combined with dimension clusters improves YOLO by almost `5%` over the region proposal network offset predictions.

## Fine-Grained Features

| :------------------------------------------------------------------: |

To better capture **smaller objects**, YOLOv2 adds a **passthrough layer** which brings features from an earlier layer at `26 x 26` resolution just like the **skip-connection** from ResNet. The passthrough layer **concatenates** the higher resolution features (second to last convolutional layer) with the low resolution features by stacking adjacent features into **different channels**.

During the passthrough connection, `26 x 26 x 512` is turned into `13 x 13 x 2048` which is concatenated with the original features. This gives `1%` performances increase.

## Multi-Scale Training

YOLOv2 wants to be robust to running on images of **different sizes**. Instead of fixing the input image size, YOLOv2 **changes the network every few iterations**.

Every `10 batches`, the network randomly chooses a new image dimension size. Since the downsampling factor is **32**, the random size is pulled from multiples of $$32$$: `320, 352,...,608`.

This makes the network to learn a variety of input dimensions.

> # Faster

YOLOv2 is also **fast**. The original YOLOv1 uses **VGG-16** based feature extractor but it's **needlessly complex** with $$30.69$$ billion FP operations for a single pass over a single image at $$224 \times 224$$ resolution.

YOLOv2 uses a network based on the Googlenet: **Darknet-19** for a faster performance.

## Darknet-19

| ![cutmix](/assets/img/paper/yolov2/yolov2_3.png) |
| :----------------------------------------------: |
|   _[YOLOv2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08242)_   |

The author proposed a new classification model **Darknet-19** as a backbone of YOLOv2. Similar to VGG, darknet-19 uses `3 x 3` filters and **double the channel** after every pooling. Also, darknet uses **global average pooling** to make predictions as well as `1 x 1` comopressing layer between `3x3` convolutions. Batch normalization is used for stabilization, regualrization, and speeding up convergence.

Darknet-19 only has `5.58 billion` operations to process an image but achieves `72.9%` top-1 accuracy and `91.2%` top-5 accuracy on ImageNet.

## Training for Classification

First, we train the network on the standard **ImageNet** 1000 class classification dataset for **160 epochs** using SGD with `lr=0,1`, `polynomial rate decay power 4`, `weight decay 0.0005`, `momendum-0.9`. Standard augmentations such as random crops, rotations, hue, saturation, and exposure shifts are used.

After training on `224 x 224` images, we **fine-tune** on `448 x 448` resolution for **10 epochs** only.

## Training for Detection

| :------------------------------------------------------------: |
| _[https://csm-kr.tistory.com/3](https://csm-kr.tistory.com/3)_ |

After tranining the backbone, we **remove the last convolutional layer** and add **three** `3 x 3` conv layers with `1024` filters followed by a final `1 x 1` conv layer with the number of outputs for detection.

If we have `20 classes`, then the output number of filters would be `5 x (5 + 20) = 125`.

> # Loss Function

| ![cutmix](/assets/img/paper/yolov2/yolov2_6.png) |
| :----------------------------------------------: |
|   _[YOLOv1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640)_   |

The most ~~annoying~~ part of YOLOv2 paper was that **it does not describe its loss function**. The above figure shows the **YOLOv1** loss function. However, the meanings of some of the variables change. For details about the YOLOv1 loss function, take a look at [https://noisrucer.github.io/paper/YOLOv1/](https://noisrucer.github.io/paper/YOLOv1/)

## Terms

- $$S$$: `S x S` grid

- $$B$$: anchor box

- $$\mathbb{1}_{ij}^{obj}$$: Indicator function that `cell i, anchor box j` has an object.

- $$\lambda_{obj} = 5$$

- $$\lambda_{noobj} = 0.5$$

- $$C_i$$: $$1$$, GT confidence

## YOLOv2 predictions

**Then, what does the loss function mean in YOLOv2?**

Recall that the predictions of YOLOv2 are $$t_x, t_y, t_w, t_h, t_o$$:

$$ b_x = \sigma(t_x) + c_x $$

$$ b_y = \sigma(t_y) + c_y $$

$$ b_w = p_we^{t_w} $$

$$ b_h = p_h e^{t_h} $$

$$ Pr(object) \* IOU(b, object) = \sigma(t_o) $$

- $$b_x, b_y, b_w, b_h$$: **Actual** bounding box coordinates

- $$c_x, c_y$$: **Top-left** corner coordinates of the **cell**

- $$p_w, p_h$$: **Anchor box** width, height

- $$\sigma$$: logistic activation function: **sigmoid**

## YOLOv2 loss function

In the loss function,

- $$x_i, y_i, w_i, h_i, C_i, p_i(c)$$ are the **ground truth** boxes and those with **hats** are our predictions.

We can modify the parametrizations little bit to obtain the appropriate ingradients for our loss function

$$ b_x - c_x = \sigma(t_x) $$

$$ b_y - c_y = \sigma(t_y) $$

$$ \frac{b_w}{p_w} = e^{t_w} $$

$$ \frac{b_h}{p_h} = e^{t_h} $$

So if our **model predicts** $$t_x, t_y, t_w, t_h$$, convert them to $$\sigma(t_x), \sigma(t_y), e^{t_w}, e^{t_h}$$ and use as $$\hat{x_i}, \hat{y_i}, \hat{w_i}, \hat{h_i}$$.

Then, the ones on the **left side** of the above equations will be the **ground-truth boxes**: $$x_i, y_i, w_i, h_i$$.

## Hierarchical classification

**YOLO9000** predicts more than `9000` classes using **hierarchical classification**. ImageNet labels are pulled from WordNet, a language database that structures **how they relate**. We merge COCO and ImageNet datasets using the WordNet. Then, we predict **conditional probabilities** at every node for the probability of each **hyponym**.
