> # Transformations of Random Variables

Suppose $$X$$ is a random variable with **PDF** $$f_X$$ and **CDF** $$F_X$$.

Now let $$Y=r(X)$$ be a function of $$X$$. (ex. $$Y=X^2, Y=e^X$$.)

Then, we call $$Y=r(X)$$ a **transformation** of $$X$$.

How do we compute the **PDF** and **CDF** of $$Y$$?

## Discrete Case

For discrete case, the answer is straightforward. The mass function of $$Y$$ is given by $$y_Y(y)$$. Then,

$$ f_Y(y)=P(Y=y)=P(r(X)=y) $$

$$ P(\{ x: r(x)=y \}) = P(X \in r^{-1}(y)) $$

For example, if $$Y=X^2$$, if we want to find $$f_Y(4)$$, then we can find $$P(X \in r^{-1}(4))$$ which is $$P(X=\pm 2)$$

## Continuous Case

For continuous case, it gets little trickier. Below are the three steps for transformations:

**[1]** For each $$y$$, find the set $$A_y = \{ x: r(x) \leq y \}$$

**[2]** Find the **CDF**

$$ F_Y(y) = P(Y \leq y) = P(r(X) \leq y) $$

$$ = P(\{ x; r(x) \leq y \}) $$

$$ = \int\_{A_y}f_X(x)dx $$

**[3]** The **PDF** is $$f_Y(y) = F'_Y(y)$$

This might be confusing but it's actually not that complicated. Let's take an example.

### 2.46 Example

Let $$f_X(x) = e^{-x}$$ for $$x > 0$$. Then, $$F_X(x) = \int_0^x f_X(s)ds=1-e^{-x}$$. Also, $$Y=r(X)=log(X)$$. Find the **PDF** and **CDF** of $$Y$$.

**[1]** We find the set $$A_y = \{ x: r(x) \leq y  \}$$

What this means is that since the definition of **CDF** of $$Y$$ is $$P(Y \leq y)$$ or $$P(\{ y: Y \leq y  \})$$. However, since $$Y$$ is a transformation of $$X$$, we can **express the CDF in terms of** $$X$$ - $$A_y = \{ x: r(x) \leq y \}$$.

Hence, $$A_y=\{ \log X \leq y\}$$. So,

$$ A_y = \{ x: x \leq e^{y}\} $$

**[2]** Find the CDF

$$ F_Y(y) = P(Y \leq y) = P(\log X \leq y) $$

$$ = P(X \leq e^y) = F_X(e^y) = 1 - e ^{-e^{y}} $$

**[3]** Find the PDF

Therefore, $$f_Y(y) = F'_Y(y) = e^ye^{-e^y}$$ for $$y \in \mathbb{R}$$.

> # Transformations of Several Random Variables

In cases we're interested in transformations of several random variablses($$X/Y, X+Y$$), the steps are the same as before:

**[1]** For each $$z$$, find the set $$A_z = \{ (x,y):r(x,y)<z \}$$

**[2]** Find the CDF

$$ F_Z(z) = P(Z \leq z ) = P(r(X,Y) \leq z) $$

$$ = P(\{ ((x,y) ; r(x,y) \leq z\}) = \int \int*{A_z}f*{X,Y}(x,y)dxdy $$

**[3]** Then $$f_Z(z) = F'_Z(z)$$
