> # Joint mass function

Given a pair of **discrete** random variables $$X$$ and $$Y$$, The **joint mass function** is defined by

$$ f(x,y) = f\_{X,Y}(x,y) = P(X=x, Y=y) $$

> # Joint density function

In the **continuous case**, we call a function $$f(x,y)$$ a PDF for the random variables $$(X,Y)$$ if

(i) $$f(x,y) \geq 0$$ for all $$(x,y)$$

(ii) $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x,y)dxdy = 1$$

(iii) for any set $$A \subset \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}, P((X,Y) \in A) = \int \int_A f(x,y)dxdy$$

> # Joint CDF

For both discrete and continuous case, the **joint CDF** is defined as

$$ F\_{X,Y}(x,y) = P(X \leq x, Y \leq y) $$

> # Marginal Distributions

## Marginal mass function

If $$(X,Y)$$ have joint distribution with mass function $$f_{X,Y}$$, then the **marginal mass function** for $$X$$ is,

$$ f_X(x) = P(X=x) = \sum_y P(X=x, Y=y) = \sum_y f(x,y) $$

and the **marginal mass function** for $$Y$$ is,

$$ f_Y(y) = P(Y=y) = \sum_x P(X=x, Y=y) = \sum_x f(x,y) $$

## Marginal density function

For continuous random variables, the marginal densities are

$$ f_X(x) = \int f(x,y)dy $$

$$ f_Y(y) = \int f(x,y)dx $$

The corresponding marginal distribution functions are denoted by $$F_X$$ and $$F_Y$$
