> ## Joint Distribution

In the last post, we looked at random variables and probability distributions of a single random variable. What about probability distributions involving multiple random variables? That's where join distributions come in.

> ## Joint Probability Mass Function (discrete)

The **joint probability mass function** $$p$$ of two discrete random variables $$X$$ and $$Y$$ is the function $$p: \mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow [0,1]$$,

$$p(a,b) = P(X=a, Y=b),\ -\infty<a,b<\infty$$

Since we have two random variables, our probability density function lies in 3D. Recall that with one variable, we found the **area** of the curve for an interval to find the probability. With multiple variables, we have to find the **volumne**.

Random variables $$X$$ and $$Y$$ have a **joint continuous distributioin** if for some function $$f: \mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$ and for all numbers $$a_1, a_2$$ and $$b_1, b_2$$ with $$a_1 \leq b_1,\ a_2 \leq b_2$$,

$$P(a_1 \leq X \leq b_1, a_2 \leq Y \leq b_2) = \int_{a_1}^{b_1}\int_{a_2}^{b_2}f(x,y)dxdy$$

where

1. $$f(x,y) \geq 0$$ for all $$X$$ and $$Y$$
2. $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x,y)dxdy=1$$

Here, $$f$$ is the **joint pdf** of $$X$$ and $$Y$$. A joint pdf of 2 variables is often called **bivariate pdf**.

> ## Joint Distribution Function (cdf)

The **joint cdf** $$F$$ of two random variables $$X$$ and $$Y$$ is the function $$F: \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow (0,1)$$ defined by

$$F(a,b) = P(X \leq a, Y \leq b),\ -\infty<a,b<\infty$$

> ## Relationship b/w joint pdf and joint cdf

From the definition of joint cdf and joint pdf,

$$F(a,b) = \int_{-\infty}^a\int_{-\infty}^b f(x,y)dxdy$$

$$f(x,y) = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x \partial y}F(x,y)$$

> ## Marginal Distribution Function (cdf)

Let $$F$$ be the joint distribution function of random variables $$X$$ and $$Y$$. Then,

The **marginal distribution function** of $$X$$ is given for each $$a$$ by

$$F_X(a)=P(X \leq a) = F(a, +\infty) = \lim_{b \rightarrow \infty}F(a,b)$$

Similarly for $$Y$$,

$$F_Y(b)=P(Y \leq b) = F(+\infty, b) = \lim_{a \rightarrow \infty}F(a,b)$$

> ## From joint pdf to marginal pdf

For **continuous** random variables, we can use integrals.

Let $$f$$ be the **joint pdf** of random variables $$X$$ and $$Y$$. Then, the **marginal pdf** of $$X$$ and $$Y$$ is,

$$f_X(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x,y)dy$$

$$f_Y(y) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x,y)dx$$

Note) For **marginal probabilities** for discrete random variables can be obtained by simply **summing over the joint probabilities** while pinned to the target random variable.
