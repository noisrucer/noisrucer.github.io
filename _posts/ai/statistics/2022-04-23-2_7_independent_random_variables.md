> # Independence

Two random variables $$X$$ and $$Y$$ are **independent** if for every $$A$$ and $$B$$,

$$ P(X \in A, Y \in B) = P(X \in A)P(Y \in B) $$

and we write $$X  \perp\\!\\!\\!\perp Y$$. Otherwise, we say $$X$$ and $$Y$$ are **dependent** and we write $$X \not\\!\perp\\!\\!\\!\perp Y$$.

In principle, to check whether $$X$$ and $$Y$$ are independent, we need to check the above equation for **all subsets** $$A$$ and $$B$$. Fortunately, we have the following theorem for continuous random variables and it's true for discrete random variables too.

## 2.30 Theorem

Let $$X$$ and $$Y$$ have joint PDF $$f_{X,Y}$$. Then $$X \perp\\!\\!\\!\perp Y$$ **if and only if** $$f_{X,Y}(x,y)=f_X(x)f_Y(y)$$ for all values $$x$$ and $$y$$.

**2.32 Example**

Suppose $$X$$ and $$Y$$ are independent and both have the same density

$$ f(x) = \begin{cases} 2x & 0 \leq x \leq 1 \\\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} $$

Find $$P(X+Y \leq 1)$$.

(Solution)

Since $$X$$ and $$Y$$ have the same PDF and they're independent, the joint PDF is

$$ f(x,y)=f_X(x)f_Y(y)=\begin{cases} 4xy & 0 \leq x \leq 1,\ 0 \leq y \leq 1 \\\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} $$

Then,

$$ P(X+Y \leq 1) = \int \int\_{x+y \leq 1}f(x,y)dydx $$

$$ = \int_0^1 \int_0^{1-x}f(x,y)dydx $$

$$ = 4\int_0^1 x \left( \int_0^{1-x}ydy \right) dx $$

$$ = 2 \int_0^1 x(1-x)^2dx = \frac{1}{6} $$

## 2.33 Theorem

Here's a useful formula for verifying indepdence.

Suppose that the **range** of $$X$$ and $$Y$$ is a (possibly infinite) **rectangle**. If $$f(x,y) = g(x)h(y)$$ for some functions $$g$$ and $$h$$ (not necessarily PDF), then $$X$$ and $$Y$$ are independent.

**Examples**

Let $$X$$ and $$Y$$ have density

$$ f(x,y)=f_X(x)f_Y(y)=\begin{cases} 2e^{-(x+2y)} & x>0,\ y>0 \\\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} $$

The range of $$X$$ and $$Y$$ is the rectangle $$(0, \infty) \times (0, \infty)$$. Hence, we can write, for example, $$f(x,y) = g(x)h(y)$$ where $$g(x)=2e^{-x}$$ and $$h(y)=e^{-2y}$$. Thus they're independent.
