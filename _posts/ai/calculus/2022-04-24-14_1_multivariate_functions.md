> # Functions of Two Variables

A **function** $$f$$ **of two variables** is a rule that assigns each ordered pair of real numbers $$(x,y)$$ in a set $$D$$ to a unique real number denoted by $$f(x,y)$$. The set $$D$$ is the domain of $$f$$ and its range is the set of values that $$f$$ takes on: $$\{f(x,y) \lvert (x,y) \in D\}$$.

We often write it as $$z=f(x,y)$$. The variables $$x$$ and $$y$$ are **independent variables** and $$z$$ is the **dependent variable**.

> # Graphs

Graph is a way of visualizing the behavior of a function of two variables.

If $$f$$ is a function of two variables with domain $$D$$, then the **graph** of $$f$$ is the set of all points $$(x,y,z)$$ in $$\mathbb{R}^3$$ such that $$z=f(x,y)$$ and $$(x,y)$$ is in $$D$$

> # Level Curves

The **level curves** of a function $$f$$ of two variables are the curves with equations $$f(x,y)=k$$, where $$k$$ is a constant (in the range of $$f$$).
