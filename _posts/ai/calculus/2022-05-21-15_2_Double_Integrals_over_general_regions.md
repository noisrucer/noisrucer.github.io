Often we want to evaluate integrals not just over rectangles but also over general region $$D$$. We suppose that $$D$$ is a **bounded region** so that it can be enclosed with a rectangle as shown in the figure.

We define a new function $$F$$ such that

$$ F(x,y) = \begin{cases} f(x,y) & \text{if}\ (x,y)\ \text{is in}\ D \\\ 0 & \text{if}\ (x,y)\ \text{is in}\ R\ \text{but not in}\ D\end{cases} $$

## Double Integral over $$D$$

If $$F$$ is integrable over $$R$$, then we define the **double integral of** $$f$$ over $$D$$ by

$$ \iint_D f(x,y)dA = \iint_R F(x,y)dA $$

This makes sense because those regions not in $$D$$ but in $$R$$ **do not contribute to the integral** in the first place.

## Type I Region

A plane region $$D$$ is said to be of **type I** if it lies between the graphs of **two continuous functions** of $$x$$,

$$ D = \{ (x,y)\ \vert \ a \leq x \leq b, g_1(x) \leq y \leq g_2(x) \} $$

where $$g_1, g_2$$ are continuous on $$[a,b]$$.

Then,

$$ \iint*D f(x,y)dA = \int_a^b\int*{g_1(x)}^{g_2(x)}f(x,y)dydx $$

## Type II Region

Planes regions of **type II** are defined as

$$ D = \{ (x,y)\ \vert \ c \leq y \leq d, h_1(y) \leq x \leq h_2(y) \} $$

where $$h_1, h_2$$ are continuous.

Then,

$$ \iint*D f(x,y)dA = \int_c^d \int*{h_1(y)}^{h_2(y)}f(x,y)dxdy $$

> # Properties of Double Integrals

We assume that all of the integrals of the following properties exist.

$$ [1]\ \iint_D [f(x,y) + g(x,y)]dA = \iint_Df(x,y)dA + \iint_Dg(x,y)dA $$

$$ [2]\ \iint_D cf(x,y)dA = c \iint_D f(x,y)dA $$

if $$f(x,y) \geq g(x,y)$$ for all $$(x,y)$$ in $$D$$, then

$$ [3]\ \iint_D f(x,y)dA \geq \iint_D g(x,y)dA $$

If $$D=D_1 \cup D_2$$ where $$D_1$$ and $$D_2$$ don't overlap except perhaps boundaries, then

$$ [4]\ \iint*D f(x,y)dA = \iint*{D*1}f(x,y)dA + \iint*{D_2}f(x,y)dA $$

If we integrate the **constant function** $$f(x,y)=1$$ over a region $$D$$, we get the area of $$D$$,

$$ [5] \iint_D 1 dA = A(D) $$

If $$m \leq f(x,y) \leq M$$ for all $$(x,y)$$ in $$D$$, then

$$ m A(D) \leq \iint_D f(x,y)dA \leq MA(D) $$
