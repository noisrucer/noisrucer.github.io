> # Length of a Curve

Suppose a curve has the vector equation $$r(t) = \left\langle f(t), g(t), h(t) \right\rangle,\ a \leq t \leq b$$, or, equivalently, the parametric equations $$x=f(t), y=g(t), z=h(t)$$ where $$f', g', h'$$ are continuous. Also, if the curve is traversed exactly one as $$t$$ increases from $$a$$ to $$b$$, then its length is

$$ L = \int_a^b{\sqrt{f'(t)^2+g'(t)^2+h'(t)^2}}dt $$

$$ = \int_a^b \sqrt{ \left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dz}{dt}\right)^2} dt $$

$$ = \int_a^b \lvert r'(t) \rvert dt $$

> # Arc Length Function

Suppose that $$C$$ is a curve given by a vector function

$$ r(t) = \left\langle f(t), g(t), h(t) \right\rangle,\ a \leq t \leq b $$

where $$r'$$ is continuous and $$C$$ is traversed exactly once as $$t$$ increases from $$a$$ to $$b$$. Then, the **arg length function** $$s$$ is defined by

$$ s(t) = \int_a^t \lvert r'(u) \rvert du $$

$$s(t)$$ is the length of the part of $$C$$ between $$r(a)$$ and $$r(t)$$. Using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, we get

$$ \frac{ds}{dt} = \lvert r'(t) \rvert $$

It's often useful to **parametrize a curve w.r.t arc length** instead of $$t$$. With $$r(t)$$ and $$s(t)$$, we may be able to solve for $$t$$ as a function of $$s$$: $$t = t(s)$$. Then, $$C$$ can be reparametrized in terms of $$s$$ by substituting for $$t$$: $$r = r(t(s))$$ .

**example**

Reparametrize $$r(t) = \left\langle \cos{t}, \sin{t}, t \right\rangle$$ w.r.t **arc length** measured from $$(1,0,0)$$ in the direction of increasing $$t$$.

We know that the initial point $$(1,0,0)$$ is given when $$t=0$$.

Also, $$r'(t) = \left\langle -\sin{t}, \cos{t}, 1 \right\rangle$$.

The arc length function is then $$S=s(t)=\int_0^t \lvert r'(u) \rvert du = \int_0^t \sqrt{2} du = \sqrt{2}t$$

Then we can express $$t$$ in terms of $$s$$: $$t = \frac{s(t)}{\sqrt{2}}$$.

Let's substitute $$r(t)$$ with $$r(\frac{s(t)}{\sqrt{2}})$$

$$ r(t) = r \left( \frac{s(t)}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = \left\langle \cos \left( {\frac{s(t)}{\sqrt{2}}} \right), \sin \left( {\frac{s(t)}{\sqrt{2}}} \right), \left( \frac{s(t)}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \right\rangle $$

> # Curvature

A parametrization $$r(t)$$ is called **smooth** on an interval $$I$$ if $$r'$$ is continuous and $$r'(t) \neq 0$$ on $$I$$. A curve is called **smooth** if it has a smooth parametrization. A smooth curve has no sharp corners or cusps.

If $$C$$ is a smooth curve $$r(t)$$, the **unit tangent vector** $$T(t)$$ is given by

$$ T(t) = \frac{r'(t)}{\lvert r'(t) \rvert} $$

and indicates the **direction of the curve**.

The **curvature** of $$C$$ at a given point is a measure of **how quickly the curve changes direction** at that point. Specifically, it's defined as the magnitude of the **rate of change of the unit tangent vector** w.r.t **arc length**. Since the unit tangent vector has **constant length**, only directional changes contribute to the rate of change of $$T$$.

The **curvature** of a curve is
$$ K = \left\lvert \frac{dT}{ds} \right\rvert $$

where $$T$$ is the unit tangent vector.

Also, the curvature is easier to compute if it's expressed in terms of $$t$$ instead of $$s$$.

Since $$ \frac{dT}{dt}=\frac{dT}{ds} \frac{ds}{dt} $$,

$$ K = \left\lvert \frac{dT}{ds} \right\rvert = \left\lvert \frac{dT/dt}{ds/dt} \right\rvert $$

and $$\frac{ds}{dt} = \lvert r'(t) rvert$$, we can parametrize the curvature w.r.t $$t$$:

$$ k(t) = \frac{\lvert T'(t) \rvert}{\lvert r'(t) \rvert} $$

Alternative vector function for the curvature is

$$ k(t) = \frac{\lvert r'(t) \times r''(t) \rvert}{\lvert r'(t) \rvert^3} $$

## Unit Normal vector

At a given point on a smooth space curve $$r(t)$$, there're many vectors that are orthogonal to $$T(t)$$. We're insterested in one such vector. Since $$\lvert T(t) \rvert = 1$$ for all $$t$$, we have $$T(t) \cdot T'(t) = 0$$. Hence $$T'(t)$$ is **orthogonal** to $$T(t)$$.

We define the **principal unit normal vector** or **unit normal** $$N(t)$$ as

$$ N(t) = \frac{T'(t)}{\lvert T'(t) \rvert} $$.

We can interpret $$N(t)$$ as the **direction in which the curve is turning at each point**.

## Binormal vector

A vector perpendicular to both $$T$$ and $$N$$ is called the **binormal vector** and defined as

$$ B(t) = T(t) \times N(t) $$

and $$B$$ is also a unit vector.

> # Normal and Osculating Plane

## Normal Plane

The plane determined by the **normal** and **binormal** vectors $$N$$ and $$B$$ at a point $$P$$ on $$C$$ is called the **normal plane** of $$C$$ at $$P$$. The normal plane consists of **all lines orthogonal to the tangent vector** $$T$$.

## Osculating Plane

The plane determined by the vectors $$T$$ and $$N$$ is called the **osculating plane** of $$C$$ at $$P$$. It's a plane that comes closest to containing the part of the curve near $$P$$.

> # Formula Summary

## Arc Length

$$ L = \int_a^b \lvert r'(t) \rvert dt $$

$$ s(t) = \int_a^t \lvert r'(u) \rvert du $$

$$ \frac{ds}{dt} = \lvert r'(t) \rvert $$

## Curvature

$$ T(t) = \frac{r'(t)}{\lvert r'(t) \rvert} $$

$$ N(t) = \frac{T'(t)}{\lvert T'(t) \rvert} $$

$$ B(t) = T(t) \times N(t) $$

$$ K = \left\lvert \frac{dT}{ds} \right\rvert = \frac{\lvert T'(t) \rvert}{\lvert r'(t) \rvert} = \frac{\lvert r'(t) \times r''(t) \rvert}{\lvert r'(t) \rvert^3} $$
