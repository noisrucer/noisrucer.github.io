> # Partial Deriviatives

If $$f$$ is a function of two variables $$x$$ and $$y$$, then

Partial derivative of $$f$$ w.r.t $$x$$ at $$(a,b)$$ is

$$ f*x(a,b) = \lim*{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(a+h, b) - f(a,b)}{h} $$

Partial derivative of $$f$$ w.r.t $$y$$ at $$(a, b)$$ is

$$ f*y(a,b) = \lim*{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(a,b+h)-f(a,b)}{h} $$

> # Notations for Partial Derivatives

If $$z=f(x,y)$$, we write

$$ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}f(x,y) = \frac{\partial z}{\partial x} = f_x = D_xf=D_1f=f_1=f_x(x,y) $$

Same for y.

> # Rules for finding Partial Derivatives of $$z=f(x,y)$$

**[1]** To find $$\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$$, regard $$y$$ as a **constant** and differentiate $$f(x,y)$$ w.r.t $$x$$.

**[2]** To find $$\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$$, regard $$x$$ as a **constant** and differentiate $$f(x,y)$$ w.r.t $$y$$.

> # Functions of more than two variables

If $$u$$ is a function of $$n$$ variables, $$u=f(x_1,...,x_n)$$, then its partial derivative w.r.t. $$x_i$$ is

$$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial x*i} = \lim*{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x_1,x_2,...,x_i+h,...,x_n)-f(x_1,...,x_n)}{h} $$

> # Higher Derivatives

If $$f$$ is a function of two variables, then its partial derivatives $$f_x$$ and $$f_y$$ are also functions of two variables so we can consider their partial derivatives $$(f_x)_x, (f_x)_y, (f_y)_x, (f_y)_y$$ which are called the **second partial derivatives** of $$f$$. If $$z=f(x,y)$$, then the second partial derivatives are

$$ (f_x)\_y = \frac{\partial}{\partial y}(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}) = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial y \partial x} $$

$$ (f_y)\_x = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}) = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x \partial y} $$

> # Clairaut's Theorem

Suppose $$f$$ is defined on a Disk $$D$$ that contains the point $$(a,b)$$. If the function $$f_{xy}$$ and $$f_{yx}$$ are both continuous on $$D$$, then

$$ f*{xy}(a,b) = f*{yx}(a,b) $$

## Q35

Find the first partial derivatives of the function

$$ p = \sqrt{t^4 + u^2 \cos{v}} $$

$$ p_t = \frac{2t^3}{\sqrt{t^4+u^2\cos{v}}} $$

$$ p_u = \frac{u \cos{v}}{\sqrt{t^4+u^2\cos{v}}} $$

$$ p_v = \frac{-u^2 \sin{v}}{2\sqrt{t^4+u^2\cos{v}}} $$

## Q49

Use implicit differentiation to find $$\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}$$

$$ e^z \frac{\partial z}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial z}{\partial x} xy + yz $$

$$ \therefore \frac{\partial z}{\partial x} = \frac{yz}{e^z - xy} $$

## Q52

Find $$\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}$$.

$$ (a)\ z = f(x)g(y) $$

$$ (b)\ z=f(xy) $$

$$ (c)\ z = f(x/y) $$

For (a),

$$ \frac{\partial z}{\partial x} = f'(x)g(y) $$

For (b),

$$ \frac{\partial z}{\partial x} = f'(xy)y $$

For (c),

$$ \frac{\partial z}{\partial x} = \frac{f'(x/y)}{y} $$

## Q62

Verify that the conclusion of Clairaut's Theorem hold: $$u_{xy} = u_{yx}$$.

$$ u = \ln(x+2y) $$

$$ u\_{xy} = -2(x+2y)^{-2} $$

$$ u\_{yx} = -2(x+2y)^{-2} $$

## Q80

If $$u = e^{a_1x_1+a_2x_2+ \cdots + a_nx_n}$$, where $$a_1^2+a_2^2+ \cdots + a_n^2 = 1$$, show that

$$ \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x_1^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x_2^2} + \cdots + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x_n^2} = u $$

Let's find the second derivative of $$u$$ w.r.t $$x_i$$.

Also, let $$a_1x_1+a_2x_2+ \cdots + a_nx_n = T$$.

$$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_i} = e^{T}a_i $$

$$ \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x_i^2} = e^{T}a_i^2 = ua_i^2 $$

Hence,

$$ \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x_1^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x_2^2} + \cdots + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x_n^2} = u(a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \cdots + a_n^2) = u $$

## Q97

You're told that there is a function $$f$$ whose partial derivatives are $$f_x(x,y) = x + 4y$$ and $$f_y(x,y) = 3x - y$$. Should you believe it?

Let's compute $$f_{xy}$$ and $$f_{yx}$$

$$ f\_{xy} = 4 $$

$$ f\_{yx} = 3 $$

By Clairaut's theorem, since they're different, such a function does not exist.
