# 1. Introduction

You've probably heard of **GUI**. However, the term **TUI** (Terminal User Interface) might sound not that familar. When we think of terminal apps, the first thing that comes to our mind is text-heavy and boring.

However, it's definitely possible to build an amazing-looking app on our terminal! Check out the [project](https://github.com/noisrucer/girok) with a beautiful TUI I've worked on to see what you can do.

In this article, we'll go over how to make a simple **TUI counter app** with [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/tutorial/). Textual is an awesome tool to build beautiful TUI apps, integrating the familiar "DOM" concepts.

# 2. Install Textual

Let's create a project root directory and create a virtual environment.

```bash
virtualenv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install Textual by

```bash
pip install "textual[dev]"
```

# 3. Our first app

Create a file `counter.py` and paste the following.

```python
from textual.app import App
from textual.widgets import Header, Footer

class CounterApp(App):
    css_path = "counter.css"
    BINDINGS = [
        ("q", "quit", "Quit App")
    ]

    def compose(self):
        yield Header()
        yield Footer()

    def action_quit(self):
        self.exit()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = CounterApp()
    app.run()
```

This is the simplest baseline that shows the header and the footer.

To run the app, enter `python counter.py`

Now let's go one by one and see what each line does.

- `class CounterApp(App)`
  - This is the entry point class of our app, extending `App` class.
- `CSS_PATH`
  - If you have a custom css file, provide the path to this variable
- `BINDINGS`
  - It's a list of 3-tuples defining **keyboard bindings**.
  - The first element `q` is the key stroke to trigger an event
  - The second element `quit` is used in "naming" the action handler for quitting the app.
  - The last element `Quit App` is a description of the key binding which appears in the footer
- `def compose(self)`
  - This method returns a single or a list of widgets. However, it's easier to `yield` them (making the method a generator). In this example, it yields two pre-defined widgets(or instance of widget to be more specific) `Header()` and `Footer()`.
- `def action_quit(self)`
  - This is where an interesting part comes in. In Textual, you prepend the word `action_` in front of the key bindings you have defined in `BINDINGS`.
  - Since we named the action when pressing `q` as "quit", we must name the method as `action_quit`. Textual will automatically match the action handler.

# 4. Custom Widgets

We want to make a counter app which contains a text field to display counts and a button which triggers a "plus one" action.

It's super simple to create custom widgets in Textual. Just like python classes, you can easily create your own widgets.

```python
from textual.app import App
from textual.containers import Container, Horizontal
from textual.widgets import Header, Footer, Static, Button
from textual.messages import Message
from textual.reactive import reactive

class CounterText(Static):
    """display counter value"""
    count = reactive(0) # reactive attribute

    def watch_count(self, count): # called when count is updated
        self.update(str(count)) # display updated value


class CounterButton(Button):
    """A button widget"""
    def compose(self):
        yield Static("Click me!")

    # Custom message -> propagate to all upper layrs
    class CounterButtonPressed(Message):
        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__()

    # Button pressed event handler (Textual built-in handler) when button is pressed
    def on_button_pressed(self, event: Button.Pressed):
        self.post_message(self.CounterButtonPressed())


class Counter(Horizontal):
    def compose(self):
        yield CounterText("0", id="counter-text")
        yield CounterButton(id="counter-button", variant="success")

    # Message handler (message from the child widget "CounterButton")
    def on_counter_button_counter_button_pressed(self, event):
        counter_text = self.query_one(CounterText)
        counter_text.count += 1


class CounterApp(App):
    CSS_PATH = "counter.css"
    BINDINGS = [
        ("q", "quit", "Quit App")
    ]

    def compose(self):
        yield Header()
        yield Footer()
        yield Counter()

    def action_quit(self):
        self.exit()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = CounterApp()
    app.run()
```

We have four components in our app

- `CounterApp(App)` - entry point
  - `Counter(Horizontal)` - container holding button and text
    - `CounterButton(Button)` - button widget
    - `CounterText(Static)` - text widget

First, the entry widget `CounterApp` yields `Counter` horizontal container widget which aligns its children widgets horizontally.

`Counter` widget again yields two children, `CounterButton` and `CounterText`.

## CounterText widget

```python
class CounterText(Static):
    """display counter value"""
    count = reactive(0) # reactive attribute

    def watch_count(self, count): # called when count is updated
        self.update(str(count)) # display updated value
```

`CounterText` widget extends `Static` which is used for displaying text data. It has an attribute called `count` whose value is a <span class="hl">reactive attribute</span>.

Instead of refreshing a component manually, you can declare a reactive widget which provides a more convenient and efficient way of handling changes.

Then, declare a method `def watch_count(self, count)` to handle that particular reactive attribute. The name of the method actually matters. It must be prepended with `watch_` followed by the name of the reactive attribute `count`.

Whenever `count` variable gets updated, Textual will automatically call this method which takes one argument which is the updated value of the variable.

To actually apply the change, use `self.update()`.

## CounterButton widget

This widget is a `button` that you can click on to trigger events. Textual already provides you with `on_button_pressed` event handler which is automatically called when you press the button.

A cool feature of Textual is that you can pass <span class="hl">custom messages</span>(or events) to all its parent widgets.

To declare a custom message, create a class with a "Pascal case" name, extending `Message` class.

Then, propagate the message to all its parent widgets by `self.post_message(self.CounterButtonPressed()`.

# Counter widget

Since `Counter` is the parent of `CounterButton` widget, it can receive the custom `CounterButtonPressed` message we just created.

`on_counter_button_counter_button_pressed` is our message handler method for `CounterButtonPressed`. The method name is no coincidence.

The message handler method's name consists of three parts

1. `on`
2. Widget class name that's sending the message: `CounterButton`
3. Message name: `CounterButtonPressed`

Then, convert all the pascal cases into snake cases and connect them with underscore `_`. Hence, the resulted name would be `on_counter_buton_counter_button_pressed`.

This method takes a parameter `event` which contains detailed information of the particular message.

Now, we need to somehow change the `count` variable in `CounterText` widget. To get the `CounterText` widget object, we can use `self.query_one()`. You can pass the class itself or query by ID as `self.query_one(#some-id)`.

After getting the object, you can change the `count` variable. Then, the `watch_count` method in `CounterText` will be triggered, modifying the display.

One reminder is that the **messages are only propagated to parents but not to its children**.

Finally, you can see that our count value changes when clicking the button!

# 5. Conclusion

We've gone over a simple counter app demonstration. Now it's time to create more advanced and powerful CLI app!
