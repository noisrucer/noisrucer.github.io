## File

- `text` & `binary` file

### `read`

```python
f = open('yesterday.txt', 'r')
content = f.read()
print(type(content))
print(content)
f.close()
```

<pre>
<class 'str'>
Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
oh, I believe in yesterday

Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly.

Why she had to go?
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday.

Yesterday love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday.

Why she had to go?
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday.

Yesterday love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday...

</pre>

### `readline()`

```python
f = open('yesterday.txt', 'r') # connect address
# content = f.read()
# print(content)

lyrics = ""

while True:
    line = f.readline()
    if not line:
        break
    lyrics += line.strip() + '\n'

print(lyrics)
f.close()
```
