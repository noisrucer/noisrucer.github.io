# 1. Introduction

In this article, we'll build a fully functional CLI (Command Line Interface) app with [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/).

**Typer** is an amazing library for buliding CLI applications backed by Python 3.6+ type hints. Hence, you need Python `>3.6` version. Typer is actually maintained by [@tiangolo](https://tiangolo.com/) of FastAPI.

Our goal is to build a simple **To-do list** app which supports adding and removing tasks.

# 2. Installation

Create a project root directory and create a virtual environment to have an isolated project environment.

```bash
virtualenv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Then install Typer by

```bash
pip install "typer[all]"
```

To see the installed packages run `pip freeze`

Notice that `rich` library, providing advanced style decorations in terminal, is also installed. We'll use rich to stylize our app later.

# 3. Our first CLI app

Let's first create the simplest CLI app with only one command.

Create a `main.py` and paste the code below.

```python
import typer

def main():
    print("Hello World!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    typer.run(main)
```

When you run `python main.py`, you'll see the following result.

Run `python main.py --help` to see the help message.

But.. it doesn't really look like a CLI app for now. We need <span class="hl">arguments</span> and <span class="hl">options(flags)</span> to make it do something.

Before that, let's go over what "argument" and "option" refer to in the context of Typer.

## 4. CLI Argument and Option

An **argument** in Typer context refers to the "required" (you can make it optional or have a default value later) CLI parameters enforced to be provided in a specific order.

An **option** refers to "flags", usually prepended by `--` or `-` like `-i` and `--force` you've seen in other CLI apps. Options do not have to be provided in a specific order.

Let's create an argument and option to make our app more functional.

```python
import typer

def main(
    name: str = typer.Argument(..., help="Your name"),
    formal: bool = typer.Option(False, "-f", "--formal", help="Formal greeting")
):
    informal_greeting = f"What's up {name}!"
    formal_greeting = f"Hello, {name}."
    print(formal_greeting if formal else informal_greeting)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    typer.run(main)
```

## Argument

In order to define an argument, pass `typer.Argument()` for the parameter. To make it required, pass `...` as a default value (`...` is a special single value called "Elipsis" in Python). If you provide some default value like `Jason` instead of `...`, then this argument will be optional.

## Option

Options work similar to arguments. In order to define an option, pass `typer.Option()` for the parameter. Notice that we provided a default value `False` to make `formal` "optional". To set the option names, define a list of positional arguments after the first argument. In this case, we use `-f` and `--formal` to indicate whether the greeting is formal or not.

Let's try it out! Remember we have one "required" argument and one "optional" option.

If we provide the argument `name` without `formal` option, then it will greet us informally.

```bash
python main.py Jason
```

![](/assets/img/temp/Pasted%20image%2020230330142343.png)

If we pass `-f` or `--formal` option, then we'll see formal greeting.

```bash
python main.py Jason --formal
```

![](/assets/img/temp/Pasted%20image%2020230330142501.png)

If we don't pass any argument, then we'll see this nice error message.

# 5. Command

In most cases, a CLI app has multiple <span class="hl">commands</span>. Git has tons of commands such as `add`, `commit`, `push`, and so on.

So far, we have not really built a command.

In order to register different commands we first define `app = typer.Typer()` and register our commands with a decorator.

```python
import typer

app = typer.Typer()

@app.command("greeting")
def greeting():
    print("hello!")


@app.command("farewell")
def farewell():
    print("bye..")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app()
```

Above, we created two commands called `greeting` and `farewell`.

To see all the registered commands, run `python main.py --help`

![](/assets/img/temp/Pasted%20image%2020230330143125.png)

Let's now run the commands.

![](/assets/img/temp/Pasted%20image%2020230330143150.png)

Now we're ready to build our first to-do list app!

# 6. Build To-do list

Let's create a python file called `todo.py` which is where all our commands will go into.

In our app, we will have three commands

1. `add`: Add a task
2. `done`: Remove a task
3. `show`: Show all tasks

Create `config.json` in the project root directory as we'll use it as the task storage. For simplicity, a task will only have `task name` property.

`config.json`

```json
{
  "tasks": []
}
```

Before we build our commands, let's create `utils.py` containing operations we need to manage our tasks.

`utils.py`

```python
import json
from rich.table import Table
from rich.console import Console

console = Console()

def read_json(fpath):
    with open(fpath, 'r') as f:
        data = json.load(f)
        return data


def write_json(fpath, data):
    with open(fpath, 'w') as f:
        json.dump(data, f)


def add_task(fpath: str, new_task: str):
    data = read_json(fpath)
    data['tasks'].append(new_task)
    write_json(fpath, data)


def remove_task(fpath: str, task: str):
    data = read_json(fpath)
    if task not in data['tasks']:
        raise Exception(f"There's no task named {task}!")
    idx = data['tasks'].index(task)
    print(idx)
    data['tasks'].pop(idx)
    write_json(fpath, data)


def show_tasks(fpath: str):
    table = Table("ID", "Name")
    tasks = read_json(fpath)['tasks']
    for i in range(len(tasks)):
        table.add_row(str(i + 1), tasks[i])
    console.print(table)
```

To display texts nicely in a terminal, import `rich.console` instead of the default python `print` function.

To display tasks nicely in a table format, import `rich.table`.

```python
import typer
import utils
from rich.console import Console
from rich.table import Table

app = typer.Typer(rich_markup_mode='rich')
console = Console()
cfg_path = "config.json"


@app.command("add")
def add(
    task: str = typer.Argument(..., help="Task to be added")
):
    utils.add_task(cfg_path, task)
    console.print("[yellow]Task added successfully![/yellow]")
    utils.show_tasks(cfg_path)


@app.command("done")
def done(
    task: str = typer.Argument(..., help="Task to be deleted")
):
    utils.remove_task(cfg_path, task)
    console.print("[yellow]Task removed successfully![/yellow]")
    utils.show_tasks(cfg_path)


@app.command("show")
def show():
    utils.show_tasks(cfg_path)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app()
```

Now, let's test our todo app.

1. To add a task, run `python todo.py add <name>`.

![](/assets/img/temp/Pasted%20image%2020230330160646.png)

2. To remove a task, run `python todo.py done <name>`
   ![](/assets/img/temp/Pasted%20image%2020230330160732.png)

3. To see all tasks, run `python todo.py show`

Great! Now you can go ahead an design your powerful CLI app :)

# 7. Bonus) separate commands into different folders

As you scale up your CLI project, you don't want to cram all commands into a single file. Typer proides a guideline to separate commands into different folder but that's for `sub-commands` like `git remote add`.

To separate single-layer commands, create `commands/` directory. Then, put all the commands we created above in `commands/task.py`.

![](/assets/img/temp/Pasted%20image%2020230330162654.png)

For demonstration, create another file `commands/greeting.py`

![](/assets/img/temp/Pasted%20image%2020230330162713.png)

Fianlly, register the commands in `todo.py`

![](/assets/img/temp/Pasted%20image%2020230330162746.png)

Let's test it.

# 8. Publish your app

What's the point if we don't publish our app so that other people could download it?
