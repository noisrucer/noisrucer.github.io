# Classic Strategy

<span class="hl">Strategy Pattern</span> is a good example that can be simplified using Python first-class functions.

> <span class="hl">Strategy Pattern</span>
>
> The Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them **interchangeable**. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it

One good example of Strategy applied in the e-commerce domain is "computing discounts to **orders** according to the customer's attributes or the property of orders". For example,
* Customers with more than 1000 fidelity score gets a global 5% discount
* A 10% discount is applied to each line item with 20 or more units in the same order
* Orders with at least 10 distinct items get a 7% global discount.

* <span class="hl">Context</span>
  * Provides a service by delegating some computation to interchangeable components that implement alternative algorithms.
  * In ecommerce example, the **context is an Order**.
* <span class="hl">Strategy</span>
  * The **interface** common to the components that implement different algorithms.
  * In ecomomerce example, the role **strategy** is played by ABC **Promotion**
* <span class="hl">Concrete Strategy</span>
  * Concrete subclass of Strategy
    * **FidelityPromo**, **BulkPromo**, and **LargeOrderPromo**

## Strategy Pattern Implementation with Classes

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from collections.abc import Sequence
from decimal import Decimal
from typing import NamedTuple, Optional

class Customer(NamedTuple):
  name: str
  fidelity: int

class LineItem(NamedTuple):
  product: str
  quantity: int
  price: Decimal

  def total(self) -> Decimal:
    return self.price * self.quantity


class Order(NamedTuple): # Context
  customer: Customer
  cart: Sequence[LineItem]
  promotion: Optional[Promotion] = None

  def total(self) -> Decimal:
    totals = (item.total() for item in self.cart)
    return sum(totals, start=Decimal(0))

  def due(self) -> Decimal:
    if self.promotion is None:
      discount = Decimal(0)
    else:
      discount = self.promotion.discount(self)
    return self.total() - discount


class Promotion(ABC): # Strategy: an ABC
  @abstractmethod
  def discount(self, order: Order) -> Decimal:
    """Return discount as a positive dollar amount"""


class FidelityPromo(Promotion): # Concrete Strategy
  def discount(self, order: Order) -> Decimal:
    if order.customer.fidelity >= 1000:
      return order.total() * 0.05
    return Decimal(0)


class BulkItemPromo(Promotion): # Concrete Strategy
  """10% discount for each item with 20 or more units"""

  def discount(self, order: Order) -> Decimal:
    # Some logics here...
    pass


class LargeOrderPromo(Promotion):
  """7% discount for orders with 10 or more distinct items"""
  
  def discount(self, order: Order) -> Decimal:
    # Some logics here...
    pass
```

* An `Order` is a **context** which delegates promotion discount computation to specific Strategy (`FidelityPromo`, etc).
* `Promotion` is the **strategy** implemented with ABC.
* `FidelityPromo, BulkItemPromo, LargeOrderPromo` are **concrete strategies**.

Below is a sample usage of `Order` class with different promotions

```python
jason = Customer("Jason Lee", 0)
andy = Customer("Andy Mac", 1100)

cart = (
  LineItem('banana', 4, Decimal('.5')),
  LineItem('apple', 10, Decimal('1.5')),
  LineItem('watermelon', 5, Decimal(5))
)

Order(jason, cart, FidelityPromo()) # total: 42.00, due: 42.00
Order(andy, cart, FidelityPromo()) # total: 42.00, due: 39.90
```
