Guide to distribute, install with pip, and use our custom PyPI package.

# 1. PyPI

[pypi.org](https://pypi.org/)

If you experienced Python before, you probably have used **PyPI** (Python Package Index) which is the Python package repository where you can install millions of different python packages that other developers wrote.

Using `pip`, you can download a package by

```shell
pip install <package-name>
```

Now, let's write a simple program and distribute to PyPI then download it using pip.

# 2. Register in PyPI

Go to [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/) and register for an account.

# 3. Directory structure

First choose a **package name**. This name must be unique so you could search to check if there's a pre-registered package name.

Let's say the package name you chose is `geek_noisrucer2`.

Now, let's create a directory named `geek_noisrucer2/` and create

1. `geek_noisrucer2/` (another directory inside the root dir). This must be the same as your package name.
2. `LICENSE`
3. `README.md`
4. `setup.py`

# 4. Write your programs

Inside `geek_noisrucer2/geek_noisrucer2/`, we will create two files

1. `__init__.py` - required for a python package
2. `test.py` - our program

Leave `__init__.py` as empty. Now, `test.py` is where our program goes into. Let's write a simple `add_one()` function which simply adds one to the given input.

# 5. setup.py

`setup.py` is where all the package information go into.

Install `pip install setuptools` if you haven't.

Change the `name` field to the package name `geek_noisrucer2`. Also, go ahead and make a github repository for the project and include that in `url` field. Feel free to fill out the other information.

# 6. LICENSE and README.md

You can look for a LICENSE example like `MIT license`.

I used the MIT license. You can find the document in [opensource license](https://github.com/pagarme/opensource/blob/master/templates/LICENSE.md)

# 7. Build package

Now, let's build our package with `wheel`. Before that, install

```shell
pip install wheel
```

and check if it's the latest version by

```shell
python3 -m pip install --upgrade wheel
```

It's time to build our package! First go to the root directory of our project `geek_noisrucer2/` and type

```shell
python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```

If you see the `build/`, `dist/`, and `geek_noisrucer.egg-info` folders, it's successful!

# 8. Distribute our package

First install twine by

```shell
pip install twine
```

Now, let's upload our package

```shell
python -m twine upload dist/*
```

![](/assets/img/python/pip8.png)

Boom! We have successfully uploaded our package. It's time to install and test it.

# 9. Install and test our package

Let's install our package by

```shell
pip install geek_noisrucer2
```

Previously, we have created a file named `test.py` which has a function named `add_one`.

Let's import this `test` file to use the function.

Cool! We have not distributed, installed, and used our own PyPI package.
