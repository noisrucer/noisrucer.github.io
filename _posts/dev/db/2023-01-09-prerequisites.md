## Introduction

As the competitiveness of our service is highly relevant to the objective and detailed information of a course, we wanted to also show the course **prerequisites** to users. A prerequisite course refers to a course that a student must have taken before taking a specific course. For example, `course A` might require candidates to pass in `course B and course C` in prior.

At first, I thought it would be a pretty simple task. However, my school, probably similar for most other schools, has slightly more complicated prerequisites.

Let's look at the Machine Learning course offered by HKU.

As you can see, this course has some pre-requisites but it's a combination of courses connected with **AND** and **OR**.

## Simple prerequisites

If the prequisites were just a list of courses connected with a single AND or OR, we can just model it as a **multi-valued attribute** by creating another table called `CoursePrerequisite`. Then, this table contains two columns: `course_id` and `prereq_course_id`, both referencing `Course` table and are also primary keys.

## Modeling more complicated prerequisites

However, how to deal with composite prerequisites like below examples?

`Prereq(C) = (A and B) or (C and D)`

`Prereq(C) = (A and B) or (C or D)`

`Prereq(C) = (A or B) and (C and D and E)`

The first example means course C requires students to take "both A and B" or "both C and D" in prior.

Consider each parenthesis as a **set** consisting of a number of courses like `(A and B)` or `(C or D or E)`. And let's assume that each parenthesis consists of courses connected with one of **AND** and **OR**.

**Then, each prerequisite is now a combination of sets rather than courses**.

Suppose our goal is to store the following prerequisite.

> Prerequisite of **COMP3314** is `(COMP2119 or ELEC2542 or FITE2010) and (MATH1853 or MATH2014)`.

We can model the above by creating a few more tables called `PrerequisiteSet`, `PrerequisiteSetCourse`, and `PrerequisiteType`.

**Course** table contains `course_id`.

**PrerequisiteSet** table contains `set_id`, `course_id`, and `is_conjunction`. `set_id` column refers to each set in the prerequisite such as `(COMP2119 or ELEC2542 or FITE2010)` and `(MATH1853 or MATH2014)`. Of course, we need to include `course_id` to make sure which course those sets belong to. Also, `is_conjunction` field refers to whether the courses are connected by conjunctions(AND) or disjunctions(OR).

**PrerequisiteSetCourse** table contains `set_id` and `course_id`. This table further specifies actual courses that belong to a specific set. For example,`COMP2119, ELEC2543, and FITE2000` belong to the same set (set_id=1) as we just saw.

Lastly, **PrerequisiteType** table contains `course_id` and `is_conjunction`. This table defines whether the combination of **sets** is connected through conjunctions or disjunctions. In our example, they're connected by **AND**.

Now, when we want to retrieve prerequisite for all the courses, we can join `PrerequisiteSet` and `PrerequisiteSetCourse` on `course_id` and group by course_id, is_conjunction, and set_id.

## Application in the project

In our project, backend API returns the prerequisite in a **string format** like `(COMP2119 or ELEC2542 or FITE2010) and (MATH1853 or MATH2014)`. Let's look at SQL code to implement it.

```sql
SELECT REPLACE(
	GROUP_CONCAT(temp.chunk SEPARATOR '-'),
	'-',
	IF(PT.is_conjunction=true, ' AND ', ' OR ')
) AS 'prerequisite' FROM (
	SELECT PS.course_id,
		concat(
			'(',
			REPLACE(GROUP_CONCAT(PSC.course_id SEPARATOR '-'), '-', If(PS.is_conjunction=true, ' AND ', ' OR ')),
			')'
		) AS chunk
	FROM prerequisite_set_course PSC JOIN prerequisite_set PS ON PSC.set_id = PS.set_id
	WHERE PS.course_id = 'COMP3314'
	GROUP BY PSC.set_id
) AS temp JOIN prerequisite_type PT ON temp.course_id = PT.course_id
GROUP BY temp.course_id;
```

You can see it returns the correct prerequisite for COMP3314.
