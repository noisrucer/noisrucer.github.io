# 1. Introduction

In the previous series of articles, we dockerized a simple FastAPI project into a container image, uploaded our image to ECR, deployed our server to ECS Fargate, and injected environment variables using AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store.

1. [Dockerize a FastAPI project into a container image](https://noisrucer.github.io/posts/dockerize/)
2. [Deploy our server to ECS Fargate](https://noisrucer.github.io/posts/deploy-ecs/)
3. [Inject environment variables using AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store](https://noisrucer.github.io/posts/inject-env/)

However, we still have one final task to do. Everytime there's an update of our service, we have to manually build an image, upload to ECR, create a new task definition revision, and update our service.

To automate this series of actions, we'll go over how to integrate CI/CD (Continuous integration / Continuous Deployment).

# 2. Create a Github repository

First create a repository or initialize git in the project root directory but don't push your source codes yet.

Navigate to your repository and click "<span class="hl">Settings</span>" and click "<span class="hl">Secrets and variable</span> -> <span class="hl">Actions</span>" in Security panel on the left side.

Then, click "<span class="hl">New repository secret</span>".

Add the followings two secret keys

1. `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Your access key
2. `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Your secret access key

This is the keys you have created when creating a user in IAM. If you forgot to save them, you can generate new access keys in "Access keys" panel.

After you created environment variables, navigate to "<span class="hl">Actions</span>" tab in Github and select "<span class="hl">Deploy to Amazon ECS</span>".

Now, you have to modify certain items in `aws.yml`.

![](/assets/img/temp/Pasted%20image%2020230331143655.png)

Modify the following items

1. `AWS_REGION`
2. `ECR_REPOSITORY`
3. `ECS_SERVICE`
4. `ECS_CLUSTER`
5. `ECS_TASK_DEFINITION` - we haven't created `task-definition.json` file yet. We'll do it soon.

If you have a different location of `Dockerfile` other than the project root directory, modify `line 76`.

![](/assets/img/temp/Pasted%20image%2020230331143839.png)

Notice that you have to provide the path to the task definition file in `ECS_TASK_DEFINITION`.

![](/assets/img/temp/Pasted%20image%2020230331144134.png)

Let's create `.aws` folder in the project root directory and create a file `task-definition.json` under `.aws`.

![](/assets/img/temp/Pasted%20image%2020230331144432.png)

Let's now go back to "ECS -> task definitions" and select the task definition revision with which your ECS instance is runnning on.

![](/assets/img/temp/Pasted%20image%2020230331144336.png)

Then, copy the `task_definition.json` into `.aws/task-definition.json` in our project.

![](/assets/img/temp/Pasted%20image%2020230331144533.png)

Let's now go back to `aws.yml` in Github Actions and click "<span class="hl">Start commit</span> -> <span class="hl">Commit new file</span>".

# 3. CI/CD

This `aws.yml` file defines what series of actions that we must perform to deploy a new version of our service to AWS ECS.

Notice that you can find that the predefined behavior is that Github Action starts deploying <span class="hl">whenever you push to "master" branch</span>.

![](/assets/img/temp/Pasted%20image%2020230331145023.png)

Let's push our codes to the repository and go to "Actions" in Github. Then you'll see that the deployment is in process.

![](/assets/img/temp/Pasted%20image%2020230331145124.png)

You can click the workflow run to see more details.

![](/assets/img/temp/Pasted%20image%2020230331145217.png)

Click on the square box to see step-by-step procedure of the new deployment.

![](/assets/img/temp/Pasted%20image%2020230331145242.png)

After couple minutes, you can see that our new deployment is successful!

![](/assets/img/temp/Pasted%20image%2020230331145329.png)

From now on, you can simply push changes to `master` branch to automatically launch a new deployment.

Let's test it by modifying our source code.

Below is the original code.

![](/assets/img/temp/Pasted%20image%2020230331145431.png)

Let's add `Wow!` to see the change.

![](/assets/img/temp/Pasted%20image%2020230331145506.png)

Let's push the change to `master` branch.

![](/assets/img/temp/Pasted%20image%2020230331145536.png)

Go to "Actions" tab in Github and you'll see that the new deployment is in process.

![](/assets/img/temp/Pasted%20image%2020230331145605.png)

After waiting for a moment, you can see the new deployment is successful.

Let's open up the browser and send an API.
