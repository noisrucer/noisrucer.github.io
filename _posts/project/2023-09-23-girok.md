## Girok

It took me about 3 weeks to release the first version of Girok. It's been an incredible experience to gain such a huge user attention while gaining invaluable user feedbacks.

I've been working on the refactoring of Girok version 2, adding much more cool features.

In this post, I'd like to discuss some of the challenges that I faced during the development and how I solved them.
